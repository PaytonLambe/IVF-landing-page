        <h2><b>Same Day Delivery</b></h2>
        <br>
        <h3>We utilize ground transportation to transport bio medical material with a focus on embryos, sperm, and eggs. 
            Our delivery range is primarily throughout North Texas, but further distances and out-of-state deliveries are 
            considered on a case-by-case basis. Our team is available 24/7 and our dry shippers are always charged to 
            ensure short-term and same-day delivery demands can be met.
        </h3>

        <h2><b>Dry Shipper Equipment Rental</b></h2>
        <br>
        <h3>It is our preference to remain responsible and liable for your precious material by performing 100% of the transportation process.
            Our vehicles are equipped with a mount for the dry shipper which secures it in its upright position and minimizes any movement
            throughout transport. Our professional team is bonded and insured and famiiar with the equipment and process. 
            However, we understand that there are those who would prefer to make the delivery themselves. Thereforem, we offer a rental service for 
            our dry shippers.
